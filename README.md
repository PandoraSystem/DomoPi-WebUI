## Web Server Instructions (NodeJs)
The web application exposes a UI (admin dashboard based on **CoreUI**) using **NodeJs** and **Express Framework**

#### Prerequisites
**MongoDB** is now required for authentication, you have to install it prior to start the application.
Database installation istructions can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center).
Once installed in your system you have to start MongoDB (more info [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/)). 
We are currently hardcoding db connection, so mongo should run with its default parameters: running at `localhost` on port `27017`. 
Config file to make these dinamic will come soon.

### Installation
1. **Clone** the repo: `git clone https://github.com/marcoredtech/DomoPi.git`
2. cd into project directory: `cd DomoPi`
3. **Install** project **dependencies** `npm install`
4. **Start** the webapp: `npm start` (production) or `npm run dev` for development (file watching and live reload with **Nodemon**, **sass** file watching with **Gulp**, **Browser Sync** )
